## Initial Planning
Should do backtesting on data to get a good estimate for returns, see if money maybe can be made

Two strategies that jump out as most feasible to start with: 
1. Whenever someone buys a stock (especially a lot of a stock) buy that stock. (Bet on their knowledge being stock-specific, & stock going up)
2. Whenever someone buys or sells a lot of a stock, buy/short the index fund. (Bet on their knowledge being on the performance of the market but just showing it through a stock)

## To Do
- Figure out how to scrape & parse politician trading data `bs4`
- Figure out basics of trading algorithms and such
- Implement trading algorithms that do what we want
- Backtest
- <GO>
